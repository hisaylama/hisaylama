# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm @hisaylama

I am an physicist with a deep interest in statistical physics, machine learning, and quantitative research. 

## About Me

- ðŸ‘€Iâ€™m passionate about complex systems - from *Statistical Physics* to *Finance* - driven to uncover novel insights and meaningful metrics.
- ðŸŒ± My primary research areas include:
  - **Quantitative Research:** Utilizing statistical and machine learning methods to analyze and interpret complex data sets. 
  - **Physics:** Investigating the properties of nonerquillibrium systems.
  - **Quantitative Image Processing:** Developing and applying techniques to extract meaningful data from images.
-  Iâ€™m eagerly looking forward to collaborations that can push the boundaries of our understanding in these fields.

## Projects

**Here are some of my notable projects:**

1. [Credit Risk Analytics & Real-Time Scoring (LendingClub Case Study)](https://github.com/hisaylama/DSF_Lendingclub-Loan-Approval-ml) - Built an end-to-end pipeline for feature engineering, model training, and a live scoring web-app. [**Data Science in Finance**]
  
2. [Graph-Based Pattern & Anomaly Detection from Images](https://github.com/hisaylama/Minutiae-and-topological-defects-of-pattern) - Converted images to networks to detect endpoints/junctions; framed as graph analytics for fraud/risk signal discovery. [**Quantitative Image Processing**]
  
3. [Interactive Analytics App for High-Dimensional Data (Chemical Fingerprint)](https://github.com/hisaylama/ATR-FTIR-Data-Hyperspectra-Viewer-in-Matlab) - Developed a GUI to slice, filter, and visualize large matricesâ€”analogous to building BI tools for portfolio/credit dashboards. [**Soft-Matter Physics/Analytical Chemistry Analysis**]
  
4. [Optimization-Driven Signal Reconstruction (Phase retreival algorithm)](https://github.com/hisaylama/Phase-Mask-for-Spatial-Light-Modulator) - Implemented inverse-problem methods to recover missing/noisy signals for optical holography; transferable to data imputation and time-series smoothing in finance. [**Quantitative Image Processing**]
  
5. [Monte Carlo Simulation (Brownian motion)](https://github.com/hisaylama/Brownian-Simulation) - Built stochastic simulators (Langevin/agent models) to study ecological problem -> transfareable to generate scenarios applicable to VaR, liquidity, and credit stress testing. [**Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics**/**Machine Learning**]
  
6. [Dynamic Phase Transitions in Non-Equilibrium Systems (Nonequillibrium Physics)](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae238/7693663#476173859)
Converted noisy microscopy into quantitative signals via a MATLABâ†’Python pipeline (denoising, segmentation, feature extraction); modeled dynamics, detected jamming transitions; published in *PNAS Nexus*. **[Code/Data](https://zenodo.org/records/11522483)** Â· [**Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics**] \
